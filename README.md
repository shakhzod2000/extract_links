# 🔗 Live Link Crawler

A web-based application built with Flask and JavaScript that crawls a given URL, discovers all internal links, and checks their HTTP status codes live using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🌐 Crawls a given website and finds all internal hyperlinks.
* ✅ Checks the status code of each discovered link (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.).
* 📡 Uses SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time link updates and status checks.
* 🎨 Displays link status with clear color-coding (Green for OK, Red for Server Error, Yellow for Client Error, etc.).
* 🖱️ Allows users to input the target URL directly in the frontend.
* ⏯️ Provides a Start/Stop button to control the crawling process.
* 🧠 Smart filtering: ignores irrelevant links like social media domains, image files, JS/CSS files, mailto/tel links.
* 📊 Includes a live progress bar (based on an estimate) to visualize crawl progress.

## 📂 Project Structure

```perl
📁 extract_links/
├── extract_links.py     # Flask backend (link crawler + status checker + SSE stream)
├── templates/
│   └── index.html       # Main frontend interface (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)
└── README.md            # You're here!

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

Backend: Python, Flask

Web Parsing: BeautifulSoup, Requests

Live Updates: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

🧪 How It Works
User submits a website URL.

Flask backend begins crawling and sends back discovered links via SSE.

JavaScript frontend receives links in real-time, checks their status, and displays them with color-coded statuses.

A progress bar tracks the estimated crawl progress.
